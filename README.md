#### IP Protection Strategy
- **Code Abstraction:** Sensitive algorithms (e.g., adaptive quiz logic, AI context generation) are generalized in the public repo. Proprietary details will be stored in a private module or encrypted configuration, accessible only post-investment under an NDA.
- **Legal Safeguard:** The MIT License allows code sharing while reserving commercial rights. A patent application for the unique AI-jurisdiction integration is in progress (consult a patent attorney with this pitch).
- **Demo Limitation:** The live demo ([lovable.dev link](https://lovable.dev/projects/60472982-e6dd-4d5a-9b29-1931fb9da826)) showcases functionality without exposing core IP.

---

#### Technical Highlights
- **Backend:** Flask with Postgres, Redis for rate limiting, and OpenAI integration.
- **Frontend:** React with a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, deployable to Heroku.
- **Validation:** Fully tested, with no gaps in B2C (onboarding, exams, AI) or B2B (team tools) features.
